# Personal Music Server & Media Player

A web-based personal music server and media player application that allows you to store, organize, and stream your personal media collection. The application is designed to be deployed on a remote server, providing a centralized media library accessible through a web interface for personal use only.

Downloading videos from YouTube, including music videos, is generally against YouTube's Terms of Service (ToS) 
unless you have explicit permission from the copyright holder or 
YouTube provides an official download option. YouTube explicitly states that users may not download content unless:

- There's a download button provided by YouTube.
- The content is available through YouTube Premium (which allows offline viewing).
- You have express permission from the copyright owner.

Copyright Law and Legal Considerations

- Most music videos are copyrighted, downloading them without permission could violate copyright laws.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python/Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript
- **Real-time Updates**: Flask-SocketIO
- **Media Processing**: moviepy, ffmpeg
- **Download Tools**: yt-dlp, youtube-dl
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd youtube-scraping
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Use `make` to run the app locally, or to run containerization and deployment. 


## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflow       # GitHub Actions workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/            # HTML pages, css, js 
â”œâ”€â”€ downloads/            # Media storage directory - all media files (audio, video, images) will be stored here
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile            # Container configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile             # run configuration for managing deployment scenarios
â””â”€â”€ webplayer.py          # Main application in python flask 

```

## API Endpoints

The following endpoint define the main functionality of the flask application.

- `/download`: Media download interface
- `/media`: List available media files
- `/stream/<filename>`: Stream media files
- `/search`: YouTube search functionality

## Security Considerations

- The application uses secure file handling and sanitization
- Media files are stored in a dedicated directory
- File access is controlled through the web interface
- No direct file system access is exposed

## Deployment and updating the yt-dlp

In you deployment server, you need to define an environmental variable $MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH, pointing to the path of the project. 
Add it to the .bashrc for convenience. 

The cronjob command is then:

`0 4 * * * /bin/bash -c "source /root/.bashrc && cd $MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH && make restart_docker" >> /tmp/cron.log 2>&1`

## Setting up Github Workflow for a remote server deployment 

### Setting up connection between the runner and the remote server

__On the remote machine:__ 

Generate a new key pair: 

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f github_actions_key -N ""`

Add the public key (contents of github_actions_key.pub) to your server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file


__On Github Action Secrets define:__ 

Add the private key (contents of github_actions_key) to your GitHub secrets as SSH_PRIVATE_KEY


```bash
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - the above mentioned `github_actions_key`
SERVER_HOST - hostname/IP
SERVER_USER - username 
MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH 
```

The `MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH` would be required, if there are multiple projects deployed on the server. It could be for example: "/home/Projects/youtube-rocket"

### How it works: 

The main part of the deployment is to trigger the `restart_docker` target in the Makefile. This is out of convenience, as all the docker commands are defined in the Makefile for ease of execution.  

```yaml
    - name: Execute remote command
      run: |
        ssh ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} 'cd ${{ secrets.MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH }} && make restart_docker'
```

The section: 

```yaml
    - name: Set up SSH key with debugging
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        ls -la ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

```

is setting up SSH key authentication with added debugging commands to help troubleshoot connection issues. Here's what each line does:

`mkdir -p ~/.ssh` creates the .ssh directory in the runner's home folder if it doesn't already exist. The `-p` flag prevents errors if the directory already exists.

`echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa` takes the private SSH key stored in GitHub Secrets and writes it to the id_rsa file in the .ssh directory. This is the standard location for the default SSH private key.

`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` sets the correct permissions on the private key file. SSH requires private keys to be readable only by the owner (not by group or others) for security reasons.

`ls -la ~/.ssh/id_rsa` a debugging command that displays the permissions, size, and other details of the SSH key file. It helps verify that the file exists and has the correct permissions (should show "-rw-------" or similar).

`ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`  __automatically adds the server's SSH host key to the known_hosts file to prevent "host authenticity" prompts during the connection.__

This entire section is designed to both set up the SSH connection and provide diagnostic information if something goes wrong, which is helpful for debugging SSH connection issues like the one you encountered.

-- Notes 

This implementation still requires to have an env variable `MEDIA_STREAMER_LOCAL_PATH` added to the `.bashrc`.
